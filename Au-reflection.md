1) I was mainly getting confused between HTML and markup.
2) Concepts were mostly clarified as we worked 
3) We asked a question about what remote was
4) I'm not exactly confused, but I keep mixing up HTML and mark up. 
5) Overall it was good and I thought it was a good way to get more familiar with the concepts learned.
